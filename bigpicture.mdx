WordPress Plugin #3 - Startempire Wire Network Screenshots
- CODE: https://github.com/Startempire-Wire/Startempire-Wire-Network-Screenshots.git
- This WordPress plugin provides a robust solution to capture, cache, and deliver screenshots through both local and external fallback methods. Its central purpose is to serve as part of the Startempire Wire software ecosystem, particularly integrating with and supporting the “Startempire Wire Network Chrome Extension” for capturing and displaying website screenshots.
• Provides REST API endpoints for external services and front-end modules (including the Chrome Extension) to request screenshots of URLs.  
• Offer local screenshot generation using wkhtmltoimage (or potentially the Chrome-php library) for faster, direct captures.  
• Support third-party fallback APIs (such as Screenshot Machine) for situations where local generation fails or is disabled.  
• Secure screenshot requests and usage through API Key or membership token verification (including partial or advanced premium membership checks).  
• Cache and store the generated screenshots in a local directory or remote storage, serving them quickly on future requests.  
• Maintain an administrative dashboard within WordPress to configure the screenshot service, fallback settings, API keys, and test functionality.

    participant B as Business Operations
    participant S as System Services
    participant R as Recovery Systems
    
    B->>S: Normal Operations
    S->>S: Continuous Monitoring
    
    alt Service Disruption
        S->>R: Activate Recovery
        R->>S: Service Restoration
        S->>B: Resume Operations
    end
    
    Note over B,R: Zero Downtime Target
```
