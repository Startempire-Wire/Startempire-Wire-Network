• Secure screenshot requests and usage through API Key or membership token verification (including partial or advanced premium membership checks).  
• Cache and store the generated screenshots in a local directory or remote storage, serving them quickly on future requests.  
• Maintain an administrative dashboard within WordPress to configure the screenshot service, fallback settings, API keys, and test functionality.
