## User:
Help me brainstorm this new bot I'm creating. This is what I currently have :  Part of a chrome browser add on (Also separately as fully functional Bot / Webapp located at https://wirebot.chat) that will include an AI Agent that will act as a guide & helper to startups, entrepreneurs & business owners to ideate, successfully start & progressively scale their businesses. This add on will include ways to allow the AI Agent to learn about the business owners business and hold the business owners accountable through

- daily stand-ups,
- end of day Q & A’s
- end of week planning
- monthly & yearly planning sessions.

The browser add on will be a system of things that will include

- graphs to plot current position in the startup process
- tracking of the business progress through Idea, Launch and Growth phase of business. (This could also be applied to new products launched after initial set up)
- ways to track generalized startup goals
- be guided in actual startup growth

The AI Agent will have access to the information collected by the add on and the details about the user and will act as a RAG application for advising the business owner.

The base of the initial guidance the user will receive through interaction with the application is “business set up” & the application of the necessary processes of general startup timelines measured against what are commonly “checklist items”

Through the bot we will track the progress of each startup through 3 stages: Idea, Launch, Growth.

Each of the 3 stages will be broken down into previously mentioned “checklist items” that will give the business owner a sense of progress through the “set up” phase of their business.

The business owner can choose to complete items out of order as many businesses may have already completed some tasks but not others. Each task will be given a priority level of importance of completion in the “Business Set Up” phase from 1 - 5 (1 > 5 in priority).

All of the information given by the business owner will be used to train the AI model to become more of a personalized Business / Startup Mentor. The AI component of the plugin will access the information given in the “Set Up” phase to intelligently make suggestions to the startup owner.

This app will calculate on a continuous basis, the progress of each startup through the “set up” (Idea & Launch) phase and suggest the next 3 items to complete according to priority. When the basic set up tasks and business models are in place, the startup owner will have a 100% Set Up score.

After Setup tasks are at 100%, the ongoing goal of the AI Agent will be to help the business ower with, current business model evaluation and business investment return metrics, goal setting & planning sessions to scale the business to profitability.

The daily stand-ups, end of day Q & A’s, end of week, monthly & yearly planning sessions will have a set of generic business growth and optimization questions with a concentrated focus of the implementation of 4 business models: lead generation, core product offers, premium value offers & forced continuity offers. The overall goal is to grow the business owners MRR.

The App will integrate directly into the Startempire Wire website and allow entrepreneurs on the website to connect their profile & designate particular network connections into three roles: Mentor, Collaborator & Mentee. The information in the startup growth journey will be directly available (within the app) with the mentor, collaborator or mentee (for business accountability purposes). Information points can also be selectively made unavailable by the user.

Onboarding (TODO)

Onboarding will involve several thing. 
1: Collecting initial Name & Email info via social Login and 
2: Brainstorming... TBD

I have currently begun to implement Wirebot as a part of a chrome extension that is built upon Svelte.  Ideally I would like to be able build out all of the desired functionality inside of the Chrome Extension Initially then separate the Fully Functional Wirebot and allow it to run on it's Domain https://wirebot.chat with the same functionality. 

Or maybe offer a stripped down core version (light) of Wirebot in the Startempire Wire Network Chrome Extension but a fully functional version on the https://wirebot.chat Website as a separate premium product. 

The Startempire Wire Network Chrome Extension 
URL:  https://github.com/Startempire-Wire/Startempire-Wire-Network


The Chrome Extension contains Wirebot as an individual Tab / Section but the Other Tab is a Fully Fleshed out Modern Web Ring that is Bieng Facilitated Through a few other pieces of Software 

The Big Picture of the Startempire Wire Network can be found in this Document :
